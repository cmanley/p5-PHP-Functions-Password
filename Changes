	- Add check and support for Crypt::Argon2 function argon2_needs_rehash() since version 0.008.

v1.12	2022-01-13
	- Use Readonly module for private constants.
	- Improve legability of some regexes.
	- Improved unit tests, in particular for long and UTF-8 passwords.

	- Cleaned up some whitespace.

v1.14	2023-01-03
	- Use algo name instead of int in password_hash() error message when Argon2 hashing is requested but required Crypt::Argon2 module is not installed.
	- Make password_needs_rehash() call password_info() as a method instead of function for better subclass support.

v2.00	2024-01-08
	- Improved documentation.
	- Moved most of the code into new 'protected' methods (all prefixed with an underscore) for easier overridding in subclasses, should there be a desire to do so.

v2.01	2024-01-11
	- Make _needs_rehash() call _get_info() instead of password_get_info()
